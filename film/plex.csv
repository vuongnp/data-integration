All Stars,movie,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/c8wy9HNWtztjItW1vMGGK2Na756.jpg,"""ALL-STARS"" follows a girls' 10-year-old fastpitch softball team and their families through a recreation league season that culminates in the selection of the coveted 10-and-under All-Star team. Lance Grayden, a veteran coach who left the league years ago when his daughter moved to an elite softball club team, and then college, has returned to ""give something back"" to the community. He assumed he'd be coaching a 16-and-under team of seasoned and accomplished competitors, but instead is saddled with a 10-and-under team of inexperienced players. Not only is he forced to go back to the basics and teach the fundamentals of the game to the little girls, half of whom would rather be in the dugout eating snacks, but he also faces the greater challenge of riding herd over their over-eager, overly ambitious, and entirely delusional parents whose ridiculous behavior is more suited to five-year-olds than adults. Lance also faces a personal decision about whether it's more important to win at all costs or to teach the girls something their parents seem to have forgotten: that each player is a valuable member of the team and fair play is more important than winning. Even though he knows what the answer should be, Lance's moral compass is severely tested by the relentless take-no-prisoners mentality of the parents as well as his own ambitions and innate drive to win. He may be dealing with eight, nine, and ten-year-old little girls, but he is, after all, only human. Meanwhile, each parent is on a mission to ensure that their nine-year-old prodigy is recognized as the elite athlete they imagine her to be, whether or not she possesses one whit of actual athletic ability. The parents' blind ambitions, combined with their grand delusions, give each parent the baseless notion that the Holy Grail - an All-Star jacket with their child's name on the back - is not only within reach, but is her God-given-birthright. ""All-Stars"" provides a hilarious commentary on the state of all youth sports today, fueled by the outrageous behavior of the desperate sports parent living vicariously through his or her child. In the vein of a Christopher Guest film - think ""Best in Show"" where it's more about the dog owners than the dogs - ""All-Stars"" is about the adults involved in youth sports (parents, coaches, umpires, volunteers, board members, etc.) more than the kids.",5857302,https://watch.plex.tv/movie/all-stars-2014,NR,13 All Stars LLC,2014,"Seth Morris,Nicole Sullivan,Mike Hagerty,Mary Lynn Rajskub,Angela Kinsey,Fred Willard,Illeana Douglas,Christian Kane,Miriam Flynn",Lance Kinsey,"James Portolese,Lance Kinsey",Lance Kinsey,Comedy

Rose came up to bat in the first inning against the San Diego Padres Eric Show and on the fourth pitch lined a clean single to left center. As he reached first base, thousands of camera flash bulbs fired off rapidly, his teammates mobbed him, fireworks exploded above the stadium and the crowd overwhelmed him with an unprecedented nine-minute standing ovation. In 1963 Pete Rose ran to first base on a walk. Baseball was never the same. From Pete's first at bat to that immortal September evening where history was made, ""4192"" traces the Hit King's rise as one of baseball's greatest and most controversial stars. Pete Rose was perhaps the most versatile player in Major League Baseball history, having played five hundred or more games at five different positions in his twenty-four year career. He holds numerous major league records including most hits, most games played and most at-bats. He was the 1963 NL Rookie of the Year, the 1973 NL MVP, 1975 World Series MVP, won two gold gloves, three World Series rings, and appeared in seventeen All-Star games among other notable achievements.",6914006,https://watch.plex.tv/movie/4192-the-crowning-of-the-hit-king,PG,Barking Fish Entertainment,2010,J.K.

In Hillywood (Rwanda's film industry named for the country's rolling hills) there is a blossoming film community. As Rwanda is still healing from the wounds of a cultural genocide almost 20 years ago, cinema has become a way for artists to express themselves and create cultural discussion. FINDING HILLYWOOD efficiently introduces the major players who set the beginning of the industry in motion. Eric Kabera founded the Kwetu Film Institute, directed the first Rwandan feature, and created the Rwanda Film Festival. Ayuub Kasasa Mago is a renaissance man within the industry, equally adept at directing, acting, scouting, or ""fixing"" just about anything a production might need. While it is easy to see that Eric is the heart of the industry, as the film continues Ayuub comes to represent its soul with his all-encompassing passion. FINDING HILLYWOOD is an award-winning documentary that functions as a Rwandan history lesson but also reveals the power of media as a catalyst for cultural healing. The film's final act takes a breathtaking final turn as Hillywood connects the people of Rwanda with the goosebumps of seeing their culture represented on the biggest screen available.",3477035,https://watch.plex.tv/movie/finding-hillywood,Not Rated,Inflatable Film,2013,"Ayuub Kasasa Mago,Eric Kabera","Christopher Towey,Leah Warshawski",Leah Warshawski,Christina Ruddy,Documentary

It is a war of material and morale. A war that mobilizes, destroys and displaces civilian populations. The Second World War was a war in which massive armies advanced, confronting whole populations with impossible choices. The manufacture of weapons transformed industry and the workforce; area bombing campaigns reduced cities to rubble; sieges doomed populations to starvation; racial policies sponsored campaigns of genocide. Told through archive footage and expert interviews, we learn how WWII shattered the boundaries between home-front and battlefield. Episode one explores the portents of total war to come; in Manchuria, China, Abyssinia and Spain. In episode two we see a world mobilizing for total war. Episode three turns to invasion, occupation and resistance as nation after nation fell to advancing armies. Episode four examines total war from the sky, charting the evolution of strategic bombing campaigns that reduced cities to rubble. In episode five we see how total war enabled the Holocaust and also examine how the fear of a fifth column encouraged the internment of civilians in allied nations.
